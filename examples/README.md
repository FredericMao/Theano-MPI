## Prepare ImageNet data
To prepare the ImageNet data for the AlexNet example, follow the precedure in [theano_alexnet](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/theano_alexnet) for downloading image data from ImageNet, shuffling training images, generating data batches, computing the mean image and generating label files. The preprocessed data files will be in hickle format. Set *dir_head*, *train_folder*, *val_folder* in your imagenet.py to reflect the location of your preprocessed data. An example imagenet.py is found [here](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/Theano-MPI/blob/master/theanompi/models/data/imagenet.py)
